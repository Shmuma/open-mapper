### What it is

Until a few days ago, trivial-http was simple-http and
simple-http was a fork of Brian Mastenbrook's trivial-http.
Brian has kindly offered to let me continue the trivial
tradition and so trivial-http is reborn ready to stumble
forth again. It  adds several features and bug fixes and
works more the way I'd like it to. Where its functionality
overlaps with Trivial-HTTP, it performs exactly the same.

trivial-http has functions for

* [HTTP Get][http-get]
* [HTTP Post][http-post]
* [HTTP Head][http-head]
* [HTTP Resolve][http-resolve] - resolve 301 and 302 redirects
* [HTTP Download][http-download]

### Mailing Lists

* [trivial-http-devel][devel-list]: A list for questions,
  patches, bug reports, and so on.

{anchor downloads}

### Where it is {id downloads}

A [darcs][] repository is available. The darcs command to
grab the source code is:

    darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/trivial-http

trivial-http is also [ASDF-installable][asdf-install]. Its
CLiki home is right [where][cliki-home] you'd expect. Finally,
there is a also a handy [gzipped][tarball] tar file.


### What is happening {id news}

2008-September-1 - Fixed horribly dumb bug wherein HTTP-GET
was doing an HTTP HEAD! Added more tests and some very minor 
restructuring

2008-July-27 - Thanks to Brian Mastenbrook for letting me
take the name. The other big news is that trivial-http is now
based on [usocket][] rather than trivial-socket.
